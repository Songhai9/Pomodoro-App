# Pomodoro Timer Application

This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built with Python's Tkinter library. The app helps you manage work sessions and breaks using the Pomodoro Technique.

## Features

- **Work Sessions and Breaks:** Automatically alternating work sessions (25 minutes) with short (5 minutes) and long breaks (20 minutes).
- **Countdown Timer:** Displays a countdown timer updating every second.
- **Visual Feedback:** Uses a tomato image and check marks to track completed work sessions.
- **Reset Functionality:** Allows you to reset the timer at any point.

## How It Works

1. **Timer Start:** Press the "Start" button to begin a session.
2. **Session Management:** The app differentiates between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks based on the number of sessions completed.
3. **Visual Cues:** The label updates to show the session type (WORK, SHORT BREAK, LONG BREAK), and check marks appear after completing a work session.
4. **Reset Option:** The "Reset" button stops the timer and clears all session progress.

Enjoy using the Pomodoro Timer to boost your productivity!
